# Assignment 15.2 – Unity Asset Store Integration

This Unity project was created to explore and integrate assets from the Unity Asset Store into a star-themed prototype. The following three assets were used:

### 1. [Real Stars Skybox Lite](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/real-stars-skybox-lite-116333)
A realistic starry skybox used to create an immersive space background.

### 2. [Vision of Stars (Music Pack)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/vision-of-stars-293364)
A soft, ambient music track that enhances the atmosphere and emotional tone of the scene.

### 3. [Cinemachine](https://unity.com/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine)
A built-in Unity package that enables smooth, controllable camera movement through virtual cameras and blending.
